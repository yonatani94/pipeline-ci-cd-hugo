## Introducing CI/CD
Deploying applications can be a tedious task, with people historically having to write their own scripts if they wanted to avoid long, manual processes. Every project and every organisation runs on a different infrastructure, so for a long time, there was never an easy way to automate these processes. For each deployment, the same processes would have to be repeated and so it took up a lot of time. Fortunately, the widespread adoption of cloud computing and investment in DevOps, has changed this.
Now it is easier and cheaper than ever, to fully automate with CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous deployment).


## What is Hugo

Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.
Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure. Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, and CloudFront and work well with CDNs. Hugo sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP.

We think of Hugo as the ideal website creation tool with nearly instant build times, able to rebuild whenever a change is made
